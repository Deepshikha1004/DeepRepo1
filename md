## 1. Physical Topology

###  Description

My home network span includes both wired and wireless connections. The **Shaw router** are located in the **living room**, distributing connectivity to several devices across rooms. Devices such as a **desktop PC** is connected via Ethernet, while laptops, mobile devices, and IoT appliances connect via **Wi-Fi**.

### Device Placement (by Location)

- **Living Room**  
  - Wireless Router (connected to ISP)
  - Laptop (Wi-Fi)
  - TV (Wi-Fi)
  - Tablet (Wi-Fi)
- **Bedroom1**
  - PC (Ethernet)
  - Smartphone (Wi-Fi)

- **Bedroom2**
  - Laptop (Wi-Fi)
  - Smartphone (Wi-Fi)

## 2. Logical Topology

### Logical Network Overview

All devices are connected to a single **local network (LAN)** with subnet `192.168.83.0/24`. The **router handles DHCP, NAT, and DNS**, and distributes addresses dynamically. There are no VLANs in use. Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections share the same IP range.

### Network Design Highlights

- **Router IP:** 192.168.83.1 (Default Gateway + DNS)
- **Subnet:** 255.255.255.0 (`/24`)
- **DHCP Range:** 192.168.83.100 ‚Äì 192.168.83.200
- **SSID:** HSNET (WPA3 secured)
- **No guest network configured**
